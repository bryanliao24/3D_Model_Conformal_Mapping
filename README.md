Spherical Conformal Mapping for 3D Modeling 

Spherical conformal mapping is implemented for 3D modeling using a half-edge data structure.

- The use of Gaussian or star maps as potential initial conditions for the mapping process is investigated.
- The gradient descent method is implemented using the proposed parameters: the threshold of the gradient descent energy difference is set to 1e-5 and the step size is 1e-2.
- By calculating the harmonic and Tutte energies, the convergence was successfully achieved, ensuring the optimization of the map building process.
